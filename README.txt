CS/ECE 250: Computer Architecture

Hours Spent: 30ish

Thoughts/impressions: Deceivingly difficult. Understanding the cache and object-oriented programming (which I have never been properly taught) were two separate things this assignment tested meticulously. 

Comments: Took much longer than I expected and it still does not function properly. Currently, I am stuck with a HashMap cache containing addresses as the keys, and Set objects (which I created as an array of Block objects) as the values. My code is heavily commented with explanations of what I was attempting so hopefully that warrants some partial credit. I may redo this homework assignment if time allows to properly understand the task at hand, and if I do, I would consider making the keys just a single decimal value to represent the Byte of information Iâ€™m trying to access. 

UPDATE (Late submission): I finished. As far as I know, it works properly.
